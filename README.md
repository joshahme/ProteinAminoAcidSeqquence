# ProteinAminoAcidSeqquence
To determine the amino acid sequence in a protein and calculate the molecular weight of a protein from its sequence
Here I have created a package named as "ProteinAminoAcidSequence" to determine the amino acid sequence in a protein and also calculate the molecular weight of the protein based on its amino acid sequence.
A write up on my package can be found at my blogg, this is the link https://joshah123.blogspot.com/2024/04/final-project-proteinaminoacidsequence.html
